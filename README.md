# Minecraft-Pickaxe-Controller

The controller itself uses a Shock Sensor for left click. Two thumbsticks for Camera and WSAD keys. The thumbsticks are also buttons. It has 2 other buttons that were added as well. 2 optional LED lights for testing. 

This was also all done with Arduino Leonardo

I am never planning on updating this
